<p>
The journey of creating Serendipity has been a blessing after blessing. Being able to contribute to my home state and implement my dream of serving the people of East Tennessee makes being a business owner so much more rewarding.
<br><br>
Since the beginning of my massage career in 2017, I have learned that listening to the client and providing a beautiful quiet space is the first step to healing and relaxation. I want clients to feel like their experience here helps them reset, and empowers them to take on the rest of their week!
<br><br>
Serendipity's esthetic is derived from the farmhouse style and sprinkled throughout the space are bits from our own farm! For the past five years we have raised Shetland sheep and just recently added Nubian goats. I have one daughter, and my name may be on the paperwork, but she is the real boss around here! When not working with Serendipity or the farm, I love to cook with my husband, Joey, and do art projects with my daughter, Evie.
<br><br>
You may think that 2020 would be a strange time to take on such an endeavor, but in the midst of all the chaos, care for the people is more imperative than ever. This environment is made to be your safe space. I can't wait to share it with you!

<div class="pictext1">
<p>"At an early age we moved from my hometown in Minnesota to Southern California and then back to Minnesota in my teens.  It taught me that it is possible to start over in a new place and cultivate a new experience.  It also taught me about diversity and I developed a love of learning about other cultures and traditions.  As the black sheep of my family, I often felt misunderstood and developed a self-critical inner dialogue.  My personal healing journey started early and has been ongoing as I continue to learn self-acceptance and the ability to stand in my own truth.  
<br><br>
My love of massage started early, as well.  After holiday meals, I would often round the table and give neck and shoulder massage to my family.  I started exploring massage as a career path in my early 20's but life sent me in a different direction and it took some 20 years to circle back around.  I went back to school for massage in 2017 with a longing to help others and cultivate a career that I love.  
<br><br>
I am an avid rock hound and have been collecting rocks and crystals all of my life.  In massage school, we had a speaker come in to talk about using crystals in the therapeutic setting, which led me to a profound "A ha" moment.  In addition to being a Licensed Massage Therapist, I have also become a Crystal Healing Practitioner and a Reiki III Master Teacher.   I create a collaboration with my client and customize the session, utilizing the tools that most resonate with them and their specific goals."</p>

<p>Knoxville native, licensed massage therapist since 2012 - graduated Roane State Community college massage therapy program, specializing in therapeutic massage as well as deep relaxation massage. From a very young age, I possessed an interest in caring for others and I’ve always known that I was here to give light &amp; love. More specifically, when I was six years old, my father was paralyzed from an incident that left him unable to walk on his own again. The beauty of this traumatic experience was that I was able to witness the resilience of people, especially my father, because he, in fact, walked again with the assistance of prosthetics and a walking cane. 
<br><br>
In my father's journey, he had a team of professionals that worked thoroughly with him, but more importantly, they educated him in what was required after their assistance wasn’t available. These acts helped me understand the body &amp; the capabilities to naturally heal itself today it encourages me to educate my clients on the importance of self care in daily living, all while assisting them in their journey to physical, emotional, or spiritual healthiness with the power of touch.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Nala and I am overjoyed to be joining the Serendipity family! I look forward to meeting you and offering any assistance I can, whether that is a relaxing 90-minute break from the world or aiding you in the recovery of a painful injury/trauma.  I graduated from Tennessee School of Therapeutic Massage's 500-hour program and took an additional 150 hours of Advanced Body Work that focused on outcome-based massage.  I have been trained to do postural and gait assessments to show where work is needed to bring harmony back to the body, and I use my knowledge of pain and trauma to support you in healing and injury prevention.
<br><br>
My own history of chronic pain has led me down the path of body work and self-care, and I am passionate about supporting others along the way. I have advocacy experience from my work at a sexual assault center and a domestic violence shelter, and I have had extensive training on trauma and how to hold the safest space possible for others. I am LGBTQ+ friendly and have taken anti-racism training at the Diversity and Resiliency Institute of El Paso.  I was also a professional theatrical belly dancer and have been teaching movement classes for almost two decades. My life is dedicated to the integration of the Body and the Mind, and I am delighted to bring all my knowledge and life experience to the table! 
<br><br>
Also, I love tacos. (Mmm.... tacos...)
<br><br>
See you at Serendipity!</p>

<div class="pictext1">
<p>I am an energetic, compassionate individual with a true passion for meeting people wherever they are on their journey.  My life experiences, as well as my experience in other healthcare fields, have grown my ability to connect with a diverse array of people especially the LGBTQ+ community.  My firm belief in a Mind-Body-Soul connection fosters my desire to see other people not just heal, but THRIVE.  My empathetic approach, and my love of deep relaxation and deep tissue massage, give me an incredible opportunity to hold space for others while they strive for wellness.
<br><br>
When I am not providing top-notch massage, I try to spend my time in and with nature.  I can often be found with my spouse and our two dogs out hiking, kayaking, or otherwise adventuring.  When the opportunity arises, we are avid travelers checking countries and cultures off of our bucket lists.  I use these interests to energize, allowing me the ability to give you a totally client-focused massage.

<p>Born and raised Knoxville civilian who only wants to be of service and care to the community. I have struggled my whole life with finding my true calling, I have stumbled upon massage by chance. I obtained my degree in Psychology/Spanish at East Tennessee State University in 2012 to help others more mentally, emotionally, and physically by attempting to pursue a Psychiatric Nursing Profession. After a year of Nursing School/ year of nursing prerequisites at Pellissippi State University I finally came to the conclusion that I was meant to pursue other areas of expertise which led me to the wonderful world of massage, due to the other sub related medical fields my Nursing supervisor recommended. Six and a half years later I have worked on a plethora of clients and learned various modalities including Stretching, Deep Tissue, Aromatherapy, Prenatal, Hot Stones, Swedish, etc. Looking forward to working with other amazing therapists at the lovely Serendipity Massage Establishment.</p>

<p>Being dual licensed in Cosmetology and Massage Therapy gives me a wide variety of services I’m able to offer. I got my cosmetology license in 2012 in California but have since transfered it to TN and have been practicing skin care with it since 2019, also the year I got my massage license. I love getting to do both equally. Each brings new challenges and new information to learn and share. Connecting with my clients is something I’m definitely passionate about as well as sharing the knowledge I’ve acquired. I am very upfront and transparent with my clients and will never give false information if I am unsure of something. I always try to do a little extra to make sure each facial or massage is tailored specifically for each individual person.  
<br><br>
I’ve grown up out west my whole life but found myself in TN in 2016 and fell in love. I enjoy the centrality of the state; It makes for so many day trips! I love food, sunshine days, and music and movies. For real, let’s talk music. </p>

<p>I was born in Tennessee and had most of my childhood here, until I moved to North Carolina in 2015, I worked in the registration office of my private school when I was in high school up until my Junior year as a secretary and got my GED that summer after, graduating early and helping support my family. 
<br><br>
My plans for my life now that I have moved back to Tennessee is to be a student and go to Cleveland State Community College in 2022. I've always enjoyed the role of secretary, but I will be going into schooling for the hope of one day being a Nurse-Midwife with my own business.
<br><br>
My aspiration in life is to make my mother proud and to make myself proud too in what I have accomplished. One of those accomplishments is caring for you when you call or come in, to a calm setting from whatever crazy life you have, to ensure that you get that break you deserve.</p>
